## Task 1 : Microbit Excellence 

Making the leds on the micro:bit "flow" as the board is moved. The accelerometer of micro:bit is used to detect the tilt (x, y, z acceleration). The leds on the titled side brighten. In this model I have implemented cases for 8 directions. Additionally, on shaking a random display of leds is shown. Python code with comments can be downloaded from the files here. Note the tinkercad code does not have comments

#### ***How to View?***
Use the link and simulate. Move the chip in different directions and the output is seen relative to you.

## Task 2 : FasPlate?

To create a toll collection system which detects Licence Plates on the vehicles through already installed security cameras and then cross references them against the vehicle registration database to fetch customer details to charge them accordingly and then open the toll barrier. Submission is in the form of a detailed report (link below) and there are example codes also attatched in files here.

## Task 3 : Cardio Wave

To analyse the data given in the csv file and find Sam's Heart Rate. PeakUtils library is used to detect peaks in 1-D data. Then the time interval b/w two consecutive peaks can be used to find the heart rate in beats per minute

#### ***How to Run?***
- Download the CardioWave.ipnyb file along with sam_ECG.csv and sam_ECG1.csv in the same directory.
-  Download the dependencies using
```
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install peakutils
pip install seaborn
```

## Task 4 : CryptArduino

To design a security system for an Arduino project that securely stores and verifies 4-digit access codes. The encrypted code is stored in a way that retains data even after the Arduino is powered off, without using external storage modules. EEPROM storage of Arduino is used for this purpose. Arduino code is also in the files here.

## Task 5 : I too See!

To code the I2C protocol in Verilog

----------------------------------------

## Task 6 : Design

## Bonus : Jumping Block

Make your own version of Googleâ€™s authentic dinosaur game that can run on a MicroBit Microcontroller. Python code with comments can be downloaded from the files here. Note the tinkercad code does not have comments. Code for collision ie game end and game restart is not coded yet.
