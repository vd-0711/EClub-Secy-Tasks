## Task 1 : Microbit Excellence 

Making the leds on the micro:bit "flow" as the board is moved. The accelerometer of micro:bit is used to detect the tilt (x, y, z acceleration). The leds on the titled side brighten. In this model I have implemented cases for 8 directions. Additionally, on shaking a random display of leds is shown.

#### ***How to View?***
Use the link and simulate. Move the chip in different directions and the output is seen relative to you.

## Task 3 : Cardio Wave

To analyse the data given in the csv file and find Sam's Heart Rate. PeakUtils library is used to detect peaks in 1-D data. Then the time interval b/w two consecutive peaks can be used to find the heart rate in beats per minute

#### ***How to Run?***
- Download the CardioWave.ipnyb file along with sam_ECG.csv and sam_ECG1.csv in the same directory.
-  Download the dependencies using
```
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install peakutils
pip install seaborn
```

## Task 4 : CryptArduino

To design a security system for an Arduino project that securely stores and verifies 4-digit access codes. The encrypted code is stored in a way that retains data even after the Arduino is powered off, without using external storage modules. EEPROM storage of Arduino is used for this purpose.
