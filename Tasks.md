## Task 1 : Microbit Excellence 

The accelerometer of micro:bit is used to detect the tilt (x, y, z acceleration). The leds on the titled side brighten. In this model I have implemented cases for 8 directions. Additionally, on shaking a random display of leds is shown.

#### ***How to View?***
Use the link and simulate. Move the chip in different directions and the output is seen relative to you.
